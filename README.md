# Description
Small project using React and Recoil called +questions.

While I was on vacation, I've decided to play a bit more with Recoil, since I liked the presentation of Recoil on React Europe 2020.
So I created small project with it, with small usage and logic of Recoil, atoms and selectors.


The application is quite simple but good enough to get your hands on Recoli. I called it +questions since it is about adding questions. Each question added has a title, body and tags. Only if title and body are filled the question can be created. The tags are not mandatory and can be added multiple separated by comma. Questions can be liked and viewed in favorited page by clicking on favorited in navigation. You can also search for questions by their title. 


Since the application was created in short time the application is not fully done. 
I would like to add some functionalities like:  

0. adding response to questions (answers)
1. users and profiles
2. most answered questions
3. testing
